Newest first. One entry per merged work package ([docs/gdd/16-roadmap.md](gdd/16-roadmap.md)): the WP id, what changed
for the player, and what the owner should verify.

## 2026-09-27 — Phase A finished: islands need ships, people are data, canon in the books' order (WPs A8, A10, A11)

- **A8 — The sea is no road.** An island lord's men no longer walk over the water: they take ship. House Mormont ferries
  its 900 men across from Bear Island in its own boats and lands near Deepwood Motte; House Crowl of Skagos, with no
  ships, waits while Lord Manderly's galleys come round from White Harbor, then lands near Last Hearth — and nobody from
  Skagos pays "the price of the Wall" any more. The map draws a host at sea as its ships, on the sea lane the engine
  planned. Any host sent to another island or shore does the same (own ships, a few boats making trips, the realm's
  ships sent to fetch it, or it waits on the shore and says why). Island lords have small fleets of their own now.
- **A10 — People are data.** Every character has a sex (Old Nan, Chataya and Daenerys's handmaids are no longer "he"),
  and every line the engine writes uses it. All 120 characters with a written history have their nature written down
  as numbers (and what sways them); everyone else is played by an archetype of their role and country and their written
  traits. Eddard Stark reads "brave, honest, stubborn, dutiful"; nothing is guessed from prose any more.
- **A11 — Canon in order.** The books' great events come in the books' order and in the windows of the GDD: the Red
  Wedding (late 299) before the Purple Wedding (300); the dragons hatch early in 299; the dead rise at Castle Black in
  early 299 whatever the "cold" meter says.
- Dev: `node scripts/screens.js` takes the PR screenshots at 1920×1080 and 1366×768; `/?game=<id>` opens a save.
- Owner to verify: `npm start` → a Stark game → *Call the banners* (all) → end a few turns: House Mormont's ships cross
  from Bear Island, House Crowl waits for White Harbor's ships; the chronicle says so, and no one crosses the Wall.

## 2026-09-27 — Phase A: the worst bugs, fixed in the current build

- **Windows:** the server no longer crashes on start on native Windows (`fileURLToPath` everywhere); all 103 tests pass
  on Windows; GitHub Actions CI on Windows and Linux.
- **Musters become one host:** the banners join the host they were called to, wherever it has marched; no more
  "Banners of Stark" left sitting at Winterfell (`tests/muster.test.js`).
- **The King's progress** walks the kingsroad and the King arrives at Winterfell when the progress does (no teleport);
  the story can no longer redirect it.
- **The story tells what happened:** the Bard is given the engine's receipts instead of the Hand's plans; story events
  that claim an arrival the engine never recorded, or retell the engine's own news, are dropped; a week's "answers the
  call" cards fold into one. Default council is now the Hand and the Bard (two calls a turn, faster).
- **Guards:** the story can no longer change the player's hosts or empty a lord's levies at a stroke; lords summoned to
  the banners or at war no longer ride off to feasts.
- **No spoilers:** the "next turn" line no longer names coming story events.
- **People:** she/her in the engine's text for women; explicit natures for 58 principal characters (Eddard Stark is
  "brave, honest, stubborn", not "cunning, cold-blooded").
- **Roads:** crannogmen pass the Neck free; the King's progress pays no tolls; northern lords no longer pay "the price
  of the Wall".
- Owner to verify: `npm start` on Windows; a Stark game — call the banners, march the host early, watch the lords follow.
  Note: if your `config.json` has `"swarm": "full"`, switch *Settings → Who writes the turn* to the lean council.

## 2026-09-27 — The Game Design Document

- Added `docs/gdd/` (00–16 + assets): the audit of the current build with a live playtest on the owner's PC, the Truth
  Pipeline architecture, the AI system with constrained decoding, economy, military, characters, living world, canon
  beats 298–300 AC, map, interface, content, audio, QA and the work-package roadmap.
- Marked `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/REVIEW.md`, `docs/PAX-HISTORIA.md`, `docs/DESIGN.md` as superseded.
